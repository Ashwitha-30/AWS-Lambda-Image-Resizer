- Uses AWS Lambda for serverless execution.
- Stores resized images in a separate destination bucket.

## Architecture
1. User uploads an image to **Source S3 Bucket**.
2. S3 triggers **AWS Lambda**.
3. Lambda uses **Pillow** to resize the image.
4. Resized image is stored in **Destination S3 Bucket**.

## Tech Stack
